Hi! I'm Alexander, a second-year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing an MS in Music and Technology. My research interests revolve around designing, developing, and evaluating innovative approaches in HCI, often drawing from my interdisciplinary background in media arts and music computing.

Currently, I'm involved in exciting research opportunities at CMU HCII. I collaborate with David Lindlbauer as a research intern at the [Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/). I'm also an affiliated student of the [Center for Transformational Play](https://www.cmu.edu/ctp/index.html) under the guidance of Erik Harpstead. Additionally, I work closely with Jesse Stiles, serving as the teaching assistant for CMU's experimental music group [Exploded Ensemble](https://www.explodedensemble.org/).

Before joining CMU, I earned my BS in Interactive Media Arts from New York University (Shanghai), where I also minored in Computer Science, Game Design, and Music. Beyond academics, I'm an avid gamer and music enthusiast. I find as much joy in playing games and listening to music as I do in creating my own games and music.
