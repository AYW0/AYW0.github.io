Hi! Iâ€™m Alexander, a visiting researcher at the University of Michigan, currently working with Dhruv Jain and the [Soundability Lab](https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu/). My work lies at the intersection of **technical human-computer interaction** and **music computing**, where I aim to revolutionize the way we engage with music through adaptive experiences. To achieve this, my current research focuses on two key areas: **(1) developing context-aware systems** that intelligently adapt and generate music to enhance user experiences, and **(2) creating AI-driven tools** that support content creators in authoring such experiences.

I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University as a master's student, where I worked with David Lindlbauer ([Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/)) and Chris Donahue ([Generative Creativity Lab](https://chrisdonahue.com/)) on exciting research projects involving the seamless integration of audio notifications into user music. This work led to publications in premier **HCI conferences including ACM CHI and UIST**, and have been honored with a best paper honorable mention award at CHI 2024.

Before that, I received my BS in Interactive Media ArtsðŸŽ¨ from New York University (Shanghai), where I also minored in Computer ScienceðŸ’», Game DesignðŸŽ®, and MusicðŸŽ¼. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and listening to music. I also enjoy creating my own [games](https://ayw0.github.io/portfolio/) and [music](https://soundcloud.com/alex-wang-796617401/sets/alexs-compositions/s-NJGasTQyLPD).
