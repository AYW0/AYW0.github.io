Inspired by Thomas Wilfred and his early light projection works using physical devices. We created an audiovisual performance using Max MSP where we capture and manipulate video signals of light projections from water movement. Due to the pandemic, this project was done in remote collaboration using LiveLab with Hope Myers(visual signal manipulation) and Arianna Lopez(water projection device).<br>
